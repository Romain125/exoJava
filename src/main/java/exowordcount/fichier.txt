When I was a cool young one
(When he was a cool young one)
I worked in the colony payin' my dues
accepting without question the prevailing views
That a young man's life was one long grind
Diggin' holes standing guard till it crossed my mind
I was wrong, all along
All that I needed,
was to have heeded

What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna matata
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries

When I was a shallow youth
(When he was a shallow youth)
Cool calm reflection I was never that good
I was a pawn in the game I saw no trees for the wood
My future stretched behind me I was over the hill
I put my best foot forward while the other one stood still
Take my word
I have heard
All that I needed
is to have heeded

Don't hafta bust, get out of the sun
It's much cooler in the shade
Some say it's just a waste of time
but they don't realize
that the view is nothing but a crime
we're all creatures world wise
